# Questionnaires

A vital part in the development of the ditCraft platform are the insights that we gather from the feedback of our community. This is why we will regularly conduct user questionnaires in order to gather valuable insights and define the path that we are going to take next. Whether it's a shift in our development or a reinforcement in our current path - we need feedback to create a great product for our community.

# Current questionnaires
We are currently running a campaign on Gitcoin, you can read more about it [here](https://github.com/ditcraft/questionnaires/issues/1) and [join here]().
